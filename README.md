# Glitch Text Effect

 To create the glitch text effect, CSS animations are often used to generate the sensation of distortion. A common way to do this is to apply a quick switching animation between different text characters, creating a flickering (blinking) or jumping (bouncing) effect. This can be done by changing the color, position or scale of the characters at regular intervals, creating a sense of instability.

 Also, other effects like shadows, blur and distortion can be added to improve the visible flaw. These techniques can be combined in a variety of ways to achieve different results and crash text styles.

 It is recommended to use this type of effect sparingly, as excessive distortion can make text difficult to read and understand.
