# glitch_text_effect
 The fault text effect in HTML and CSS creates a distorted, retrograde visual, simulating glitches or digital interference. Using CSS animations, colors, positions, and scales are changed periodically, resulting in a flickering or jumping effect. It is important to use this effect sparingly, as too much distortion can impair the readability of the text.
